# Dynamic Rest API using NestJS and JSON Schema

This project is no longer actively maintained. It's goal was to provide an easy starting point for quickly prototyping new rest apis.

The app provides boilderplate for  Azure Key Vault and CosmosDB use from Typescript applications and makes it easy for users to write json schemas to provide new entities through the api. This api can also accomodate hooks that allow users to customize behavior on a per entity basis.

Check the schemas directory for example schemas and the hooks.ts file for how hooks fcan be imnplemented.
